ISSUE : 
    If getting the below issue while connecting to postgres at "localhost:5432", through postgres-client :
    - [role "postgres" does not exist]

RESOLUTION:
    The issue may be because of Postgres instance running locally (probably from another project), so try running 
    "brew services stop postgresql" (assuming its installed with Homebrew). This will most probably resolve the issue.

(2)   
ISSUE :
    Postgres is not getting started in docker:
RESOLUTION:
    Keep the 'db-data/postgres' folder completely empty. Remove the '.gitkeep' files from both 'postgres' & 'mongo' folders.
    '.gitkeep' is kept to just keep track of the folder, as git does not track empty folders.
